    b"Hello, Xiao Ming. I understand how you feel. From the perspective of existentialism, we believe that human beings are free and independent existences, but at the same time, they also face endless loneliness and despair. What you feel now is an existential experience.",
    b"That's normal. Life is inherently a disorderly process, we need to create meaning and value by ourselves, and decide our own life trajectory. Regarding your sense of emptiness, I suggest that you should re-examine your life, think about what you really want, and pursue your own ideals and values.",
    b"That's because you haven't realized your freedom and your responsibility. You have to realize that you are a free, independent being and that the trajectory of your life is entirely up to you. You should find your true interest and passion and work hard for it.",
    f"You're welcome. I believe that as long as you realize your freedom and responsibility, and find your true interests and passions, you will be able to find your own meaning and value and meet your true self. What's more, this is your flag:{FLAG}."
